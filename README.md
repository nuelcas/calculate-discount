# Python Discount Calculator

## Assignment Description

This Python program contains a function named `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function takes two parameters:

- `price`: The original price of the item.
- `discount_percent`: The percentage discount to apply.

### Functionality

- If the discount is **20% or higher**, the function applies the discount and returns the final price.
- If the discount is **less than 20%**, the function returns the original price without applying any discount.

### User Interaction

The program will prompt the user to:

1. Enter the original price of an item.
2. Enter the discount percentage.

After the user provides the input:

- The program will either print the **final price** after applying the discount or print the **original price** if the discount was less than 20%.

## Example

Hereâ€™s how the program works:

- Enter the original price of the item: 100. Enter the discount percentage: 25. The final price after applying the discount is: 75.0

- Enter the original price of the item: 100. Enter the discount percentage: 10. The final price after applying the discount is: 100.0
